# Netlify configuration removed — repository now uses Vercel for hosting.
#
# If you accidentally landed here, note:
# - Vercel uses `vercel.json` for rewrites/headers and the project is configured
#   to use `vercel.json` at the repository root instead of `netlify.toml`.
# - You can delete this file safely. It is left here as a placeholder note.
